# Employee-attrition
Research by Team Tenet on Employee attrition dataset prepared by IBM Data Scientist to confirm the claim that monthly incomes earned by attrition employees with a masters degree is not different from that earned by those with a bachelors degree
# Description
People are the lifeblood of an organization. Companies need employees who are fit to do their work. But there’s a reality that every organization, big or small, has to face: movement within the workforce and teams is inevitable. Employees come, and employees go.
Employee attrition refers to employees’ loss through a natural process, such as retirement, resignation, elimination of a position, personal health, or other similar reasons. 
We will be looking into the factors that lead to employee attrition in a company using a dataset that was fictionally created by data scientists at IBM to explore similar cases.
